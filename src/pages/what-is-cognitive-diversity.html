<p>Cognitive diversity is an umbrella term for changes that occur within the brain that are considered to be normal variations or a normal result of challenging life experiences. These changes allow people to process information in different and often new and creative ways. The cogntively diverse will often process and address problems differently, see details others might not notice, ask question others might not think to ask and more. This means that cognitive diversity can be a largely a positive thing, especially in an environment with diversity and inclusion in mind. </p>
