<p>Candidates should be asked how to they prefer to learn/process and choose from examples or a few different options. Hiring teams should think about hiring someone because of their skills and not to be compliant with the law. People should come first than their neurodiversity and the company in a nonjudgmental and equitable environment conduct the interview to find qualified candidates that may learn differently. </p>

<p>Everyone should have the same right to show their capabilities at work. An equity hiring process will make this possible!</p>


<p>(maybe) walk through interview by role, and “suggest a better process” with each breakdown. Pull details from interviews and resource articles. </p>
