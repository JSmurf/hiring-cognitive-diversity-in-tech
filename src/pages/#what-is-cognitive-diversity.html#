<p>Cognitive diversity is an umbrella term for changes that occur within the brain that are considered to be normal variations. These changes allow people to process information in different and often new and creative ways. This means that cognitive diversity is largely a positive thing. </p>

<p>It is important to have a diverse team where employees know they can easily access tools or equitable accommodations or options effectively (and without judgment). This acceptance can increase creativity, motivation, and consequently productivity. Accepting differences allows for a more equitable world. People may process, learn, remember and convey information differently. </p>
